    <br> Dear Mr. Smith,
  </p>
  <p>
    I am writing you to express my interest in a full time Inside Sales Representative position. I have researched your organization and feel I have much to offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have many strengths to offer, but will focus on three core strengths that I feel will add value to this role; strong communication skills, self-starter and a Bachelor’s Degree.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Communication</b> – I have presented at a variety of professional organization meetings.</li>
    <li><b>Self-Starter</b> – I started a non-profit organization to help veterans and their families.</li>
    <li><b>Bachelor’s Degree</b> – in business from the University of Phoenix</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I am excited to take the next step in my career and believe my background uniquely qualifies me for this role and my experience in training will allow me to contribute from day one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have included my resume for your review, and look forward to hearing from you. Thanks you for your consideration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>
  <p>
    <br> Janet Jones
