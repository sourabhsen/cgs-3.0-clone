  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sales</b> – Won the “Top Sales” competition in 2012 out of 45 other reps based on overall growth, competitor conversations and new account setups.</li>
    <li><b>Communication</b> – Trained over 300 associates on how to effectively promote Star products.</li>
    <li><b>Prospecting</b> – Penetrated dozens of profitable B2B accounts, individually valued up to $1M, with major Fortune 500 customers.</li>
