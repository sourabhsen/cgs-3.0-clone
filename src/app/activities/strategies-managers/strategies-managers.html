<p>Do you like finding 500 spam emails in your inbox every morning? Nobody does -- hiring managers least of all. So resist the temptation to just blanket the marketplace with your generic resume in hopes that something will “stick.” Hiring managers hate being bombarded by dozens of applicants who likely don't even fit the qualifications they want.</p>
<p>Successful job-seekers understand that landing your next position is about quality versus quantity. So take the time to make each application count. And that means not only reading job descriptions carefully, it also means creating custom versions of your resume that are specifically targeted towards each position you apply for.</p>
