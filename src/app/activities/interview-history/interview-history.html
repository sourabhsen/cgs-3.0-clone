<p><b>How to explain when and why you changed jobs.</b></p>
<p>What happens when you leave a job? Whether you quit, you're fired, or you're laid off, it's called a “transition.” Employers will be curious about your job transitions, and for good reason. If your resume shows you're a job-hopper who changes positions every year (or even more!), that can be red flag for hiring managers.</p>
<p>You should be able to tell a story that sums up why you left each job, and how each one of those situation impacts your career today. Always focus on the positive, like what you learned from a job or employer, even if you were fired. Being negative or bitter during an interview can knock you out of contention, fast.</p>

<p><b>Here are some professional ways to explain why you left past jobs that cover both positive and negative circumstances:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>My company went through some restructuring, and our team/position was eliminated (layoff).</li>
  <li>My manager and I had a very in depth conversation about what my future career goals are and we decided it made sense for me to find a position that aligns more with my future goals (you got fired).</li>
  <li>I am seeking to advance my career and this position will allow me to maximize my talents by making an immediate impact (you can't get promoted at your current company so you're looking elsewhere).</li>
  <li>I took the last few years off to raise my children full-time. During that time I stayed current in my field and now that they are more independent, I am ready to focus on my career goals (you left for maternity leave and elected not to return).</li>
  <li>After doing some research and speaking with people in the industry, I've determined that my skillset could really add value to this industry (you want to move up the ladder or change industries).</li>
  <li>My spouse got transferred to another city so I chose to leave my position and look for something in our new location. After researching many organizations, I found that yours is a great fit for my skills (this is a common situation for many spouses, especially military spouses).</li>
  <li>I've been doing some project-based consulting (if you've been self-employed, or did short-term freelancing or temp work between jobs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared to expand on any of these situations when asked, always focusing on how each situation helped you grow professionally. But no matter the situation,<b><i> your explanation must still be true.</i></b> If you feel that you cannot be truthful about a past employer, don't mention them at all.</p>
