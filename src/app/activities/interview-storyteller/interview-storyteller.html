<p><b>Don't get bogged down thinking about how you might answer an infinite number of possible interview questions.</b> Instead, rehearse some good stories you can share with the hiring manager that help illustrate your work ethic, your skillset, and your unique talents. Did you ever pull an all-nighter to get a key project finished in time? Have you ever helped rescue a failing campaign with a great new idea? Where are you from, and what have you learned? What are your values? If you can tell an entertaining story that also showcases what you have to offer, you'll be ready for any question.</p>
<p><b>When crafting your stories, think "PAR", or <i>Problem, Action and Result.</i></b> This means you briefly describe the problem you faced in a past or current position, the actions you took to fix that problem, and the results. Jot down some possible stories onto notecards and practice with them. For example, one story about teamwork, another about top achievements, one on conflict resolution, and so on. They don't have to be long either, a paragraph you can describe in five minutes or less is ideal.</p>

<p><b>Here's an example of a story structure that you can use to answer almost any kind of interview question.</b> Note the use of the PAR technique!</p>
<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Tell me about a time when you worked in a group.</p>
<p><b>Interviewee:</b> I did lots of group projects in my degree program. In my child psychology class, my team of five had to develop a presentation about childhood behavior problems and present it back to my class. My role was to ensure everyone completed their sections on time, complete my own section, and then compile everything into a slideshow, while keeping it to 30 minutes (<u>problem</u>). To stay on schedule, I sent out reminders, made sure no one was having difficulty with their assigned topics, and emailed my piece to everyone well in advance so they could use it as an example (<u>action</u>). Thanks to this, everyone met the deadline, and we got an A (<u>result</u>)!</p>
<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Describe a situation when you have gone above and beyond your normal duties.</p>
<p><b>Interviewee:</b> A customer called to complain that they had waited for more than two weeks for a reply from our sales team regarding a product inquiry (<u>problem</u>). I needed to address the client's immediate inquiry and investigate what had happened in our normal process. I apologized, got the details and passed them to our head salesperson, who contacted the client within the hour. I researched why no one had originally contacted the customer two weeks prior and discovered that it was a combination of a wrong number and a generic email address. I let the client know and we offered a goodwill discount on her next order. I also set a report within our system to do a weekly check to cross reference name, phone number, and email for our customers (<u>action</u>). The client not only continued to order from us but posted a positive customer service tweet. Now, if there is a discrepancy in our system, our team will proactively reach out to confirm customer contact information (<u>result</u>).</p>
