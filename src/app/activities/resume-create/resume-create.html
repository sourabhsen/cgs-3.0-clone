<h3>How do you tailor your resume for a specific job?</h3>
<p>You want to make it as easy as possible for a hiring manager to quickly see why YOU are the right person for the job. This means that you should tailor your resume for EVERY job that you apply to.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Print</b> out the job description or paste it into the "notes" section of our Resume Builder tool</li>
  <li><b>Read</b> through the job description carefully. (You should fully understand what this job entails.)</li>
  <li><b>Highlight</b> the key parts of the job description</li>
  <li><b>Make sure that the skills and experience you list are the ones the outlined in the job description</b>. (Just make sure that you only add skills and experience that you actually have.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the most important parts of the job description?</h3>
<p>Job descriptions come in all shapes and sizes, however most have very similar sections. When going through and highlighting the important parts of the job posting, read every word.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Read EVERY word</b> - It's easy to miss a key requirement like "expert with Excel" buried in a long list of generic requirements.</li>
  <li><b>Dismiss the fluff</b> - You'll see general requirements like "strong verbal communication skills" in a lot of job descriptions. This is important to keep in mind, however you want to focus on the requirements that are specific to this job.</li>
  <li><b>Focus on the job requirements</b> - Is a Bachelor degree required? Are certain certifications required? Do you need to be an expert with a certain type of software? How many years of experience do they want you to have? These are the items that you want to make sure your resume addresses.</li>
  <li><b>Refer to the job duties</b> - Read between the lines. If they say that you will spend 8 hours a day on the phone with customers, those "strong verbal communications skills" are probably very important.</li>
  <li><b>Pay attention to the skills</b> - Highlight the important skills so you can include the ones you have in the skills section of your resume</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, hiring managers often receive hundreds of resumes for a single position. They should read your resume and realize that you are a great match. When you finish your resume, re-read the job description and then read your resume. Would you hire yourself?</p>
