<p><b>What makes a powerful brand?</b> Think Nike -- a brand that says so much just with that single, familiar swoosh. Nike means strength, athleticism, power, and success -- and the famous Nike logo tells you to “just do it” without any words. You don’t have to think about what Nike means, it’s already understood. Personal branding is like that, too -- only it’s creating an experience that will make people think of you, and only you. From your fashion sense to your work ethic, personal branding is about showcasing excellence while setting yourself apart.</p>
<p><b>How do you brand yourself?</b> First define who you are, what you do, and what your strengths are. Are you the first person people turn to when they need a deadline met? Can you fix a line of software code in your sleep? Are you trustworthy and discreet? Are you cool under pressure? It’s more than just making a laundry list; you brand yourself when you live<i> </i>those values. If you’re the best computer programmer, admin assistant, or marketing guru in your network and everyone knows it, employers will start flocking to you instead of the other way around.</p>
<p><b>What makes your brand unique?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>How you look -- in person and online.</li>
<li>How you communicate -- verbally and in writing.</li>
<li>Your work ethic -- how well you tackle and complete tough assignments.</li>
<li>The quality of your personal and professional network -- Who you know DOES matter!</li>
</ul>
