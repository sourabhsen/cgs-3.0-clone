<p>Following up on a job application can be tricky, you must show persistence without being annoying. Here are few things to consider:</p>
<p><b>Send a thank-you note.</b> Saying thank you is an essential step in the job-interview process. Do it within 24 hours of the interview, either by email (preferred) or regular mail (rare, but customary in conservative industries like finance). Use the note to restate your interest in the position and the company, and mention something interesting about what you discussed. Keep it cordial, yet brief.</p>
<p>Not sure what to write? Here's a sample thank-you note to model yours on.</p>
<div class="well">
  <p>Dear Emily,</p>
  <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me on Monday about the Health Care Quality Improvement Strategist position at Elgin Community Hospital.</p>
  <p>I enjoyed our conversation and appreciate you sharing your perspective on the current changes in the healthcare industry. I found your insight on the confidentiality and uniformity challenges of electronic medical records to be particularly interesting.</p>
  <p>I would like to reiterate my excitement for this position. Learning more about the cross-functional nature of the role reinforced my belief that my project management, organizational, and leadership skills make me a great fit.</p>
  <p>Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing about next steps.</p>
  <p>Best,</p>
  <p>Andrew Michelson</p>

<p><b>Wait a week. </b>While it's customary to send the initial thank-you note within 24 hours of the interview, wait at least a week before any further follow-ups so hiring managers can have enough time to thoroughly review your application and compare you to their other candidates. Be patient, remember that managers have other tasks besides hiring you.</p>
<p><b>Not sure who you should follow up with?</b> Never fear, just follow this simple rule of thumb<b>. </b>Start with the person(s) who interviewed you. Hopefully you got their email addresses during the interview, but if not, you can probably find their email addresses on the company website or through LinkedIn. This should be your first follow up contact.</p>
<p>If you cannot find their email addresses, email the recruiter (usually in the company's HR department). If you don't have the recruiter's email, do an advanced search on LinkedIn and invite the recruiter into your network, with a brief note in the message section following up on the status of your application. Last but not least, you can call the HR department and ask for the best way to send your follow-up note.</p>
