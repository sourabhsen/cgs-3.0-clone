<p>You've learned about common interview questions as well as how to respond to them. Now it's crunch time. At the end of the interview, the hiring manager may say, "Well, that's all I have. Do you have any questions for me?"</p>
<p>DON'T shrug it off and just say "no."</p>
<p><b>Employers expect you to have questions</b>, and you can demonstrate your enthusiasm for the position and the company by asking thoughtful ones. So it pays to prepare accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Here are some examples of good questions to ask during an interview, and why:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>"How would you describe success in this position?"</b> When you ask this question, you identify yourself as someone who expects to be successful. Pay close attention to the hiring manager's response, because it will give you a good indication of how your job performance could be judged in the future.</li>
  <li><b>"What are some of this position's key challenges?"</b> This shows you understand and accept that no job is without challenges. After the employer responds, you might have the opportunity to share a similar challenge from your past experience, and how you addressed it.</li>
  <li><b>"How is the company responding to [insert current trend/event]?"</b> Asking this question shows hiring managers you're up-to-date on industry trends. The interviewer might turn it back to you, saying, "Great question, what do YOU think?" Be prepared to give a thoughtful answer. Stay away from anything too negative or controversial, like bad press or pending lawsuits.</li>
  <li><b>"How does this department support the overall company mission and vision?"</b> Refer to specific points within the company mission and vision when you ask this question. For example, you could say, "I see that AT&amp;T has a strong commitment to improving local communities. How do you support that mission? Do you do volunteer work, or donate a portion of profits to charity? How can I help?" You''ll show engagement and enthusiasm with this approach!</li>
  <li><b>"What are the next steps in the hiring process?"</b> This should always be the last question you ask. When you ask this question, you demonstrate enthusiasm and a desire to move the hiring process forward. Whether the hiring manager says the company will call you when it makes a decision or you choose to follow up in a week or so, always send a thank-you note to the interviewer(s) within 24 hours of your meeting.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you're finished asking your questions, be sure to thank the hiring manager for answering them. End the interview with a firm handshake, and thank them again for their time and consideration.</p>
<p><b>Do NOT ask any of these questions during an interview. They'll make you look unprofessional and hurt your chances of getting hired.</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't ask any questions that are easily answered on the company's website or via a basic Internet search – or worse yet, don't ask things you should already know, like the name of the company's CEO or whether it's profitable! It will make you seem unprepared and uninterested.</li>
  <li>Do not ask questions about salary, vacation, or benefits at this stage of the process – wait until you have an actual offer on the table to discuss these. (If the hiring manager asks you for your salary requirements first, however, it's okay to respond.)</li>
  <li>Do not ask any personal questions unless the interview initiates this type of dialogue (e.g., inquiring about their family, favorite hobbies, etc.) of the hiring manager or other interviewers. This is very unprofessional.</li>
</ol>
