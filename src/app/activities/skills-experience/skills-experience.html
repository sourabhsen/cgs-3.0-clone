<p>Gaining relevant experience can help you develop the skills you need for your career goals. But if you don't have a job yet, how do you get either?</p>
<p>Don't panic. Your degree program is already helping you obtain knowledge in these areas. And there are lots of other ways to gain career skills, too -- both with and without a paycheck.</p>
<p><b>Check out the many ways you can build your skills:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Volunteering.</b> If marketing is your forte, help a local charity promote their annual fundraising campaign. Aspiring nurses, try teaching CPR at your local Red Cross chapter. And so on. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/">volunteermatch.org</a> to find opportunities near you.</li>
  <li><b>Internships and Co-ops.</b> Use these opportunities to develop skills in your chosen field. Co-ops are usually full-time with some pay and occur when students are taking a break from studies. Internships are often unpaid and done solely for the experience.</li>
  <p>You can explore internship opportunities through our University of Phoenix <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId:'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search tool</a>.</p>

  <li><b>Job Shadowing.</b> Many companies will allow students to "shadow" a working professional to learn more about a job. When shadowing, you may be asked to perform simple tasks, which essentially serves as on-the-job training!</li>
  <li><b>Becoming an Assistant. </b>Being someone's personal assistant, even on a volunteer basis, is a great way to learn more about an industry. While making coffee or setting appointments isn't glamorous, doing a good job can get you a great recommendation -- or important contacts.</li>
  <li><b>Volunteering Where You Work.</b> If you're already employed, try "volunteering" at your job. Ask your supervisor if you can volunteer some of your time with another department or on a project that's outside your comfort zone. You'll stretch yourself and maybe even find a new career path in the process!</li>
  <li><b>Working Part-Time.</b> Moonlighting, anyone? Look for a gig where you can work a few days a week or a few hours a day around your existing work or school schedule. Gain new skills while showing employers how disciplined and flexible you are. Visit the University's <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId:'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search tool</a> to research thousands of part-time and full-time positions posted by hundreds of employers.</li>
  <li><b>Tutoring.</b> Try teaching others what you already know! Nonprofit organizations and schools need volunteer tutors for kids. Or try being a private hourly tutor if you have a knack for math, science, or foreign languages.</li>
  <li><b>Participating in Class Projects.</b> Did you help lead a learning team? Wow your instructor with a cutting-edge business idea? This is work experience you can share with potential employers.</li>
