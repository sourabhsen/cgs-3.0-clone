<p>You've worked long and hard establishing your network, so now it's time to put it to good use. People can't help you find a job if they don't know you're looking! Keep them informed through carefully crafted emails and social media posts about your job hunt.</p>
<p><b>Here are some sample e-mail and social media posts that can help you notify your network that you are looking for a job:</b></p>
