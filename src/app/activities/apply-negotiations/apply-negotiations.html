<p>All of the hard work you put into your search really paid off -- YOU GOT THE JOB! But don't accept the offer just yet, there's a lot more to consider than just the paycheck. Study the complete benefits package, work environment and company mission. Always analyze the pros and cons of each job offer, especially if you're lucky enough to have more than one!</p>
<h3>Here are our tips for evaluating job offers like a pro:</h3>
<p><b>Salary</b></p>
<p>It is important to determine the salary range you're willing to accept ahead of time. Before considering any job offer, review your <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'careerExploration', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>career goal list</a> to help you assess typical salary for similar positions in your area. Make sure you communicate your desired compensation to the company as soon as they ask for it.</p>
<p>Some companies will request you submit your salary requirements upfront in your cover letter, while others won't discuss it until an offer is on the table. Follow the company's lead, but also be prepared to negotiate. You can often negotiate a higher salary than their first offer, especially if you have competing job offers. But if you've been out of work a long time or the job market is bad, this might not always be an option.</p>
<p><b>Health Insurance and Other Benefits</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Health insurance and related benefits often form a significant portion of any job's compensation. Does the employer offer dental, vision, disability or life-insurance benefits in addition to health insurance? Do the insurance plans offered also cover dependents? What are the co-pays? Is there a deductible? Is your doctor in the plan? And most important, how much are the premiums? Is it cheaper or better than insurance you can buy yourself?</p>
<p>Some companies offer additional benefits, like health club memberships, tuition reimbursement, employee discounts at major retailers, travel discounts, generous vacation and personal-time allowances, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance plans. Sometimes a lower salary can be worth it when companies offer generous benefit packages.</p>
<p><b>Retirement</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Retirement plans can vary greatly from one employer to another, so ask the hiring manager as many questions as you can if you aren't sure what they're offering you. Does the company have a 401(k) or pension plan? Does the employer match your contributions? If so, how much is the match, and how long does it take before you're 100% vested in the match? Employer 401(k) matches can be a significant part of your overall compensation!</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <b>Time Off</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Find out about paid holiday, vacation and leave time (sick time, maternity/paternity leave and bereavement leave). How much leave time will you accrue per paycheck? Does leave time rollover at the end of the year? How many paid holidays will you get each year? Do you have to work for the company for a set period of time before you can use these benefits? Some companies also allow employees to take extended unpaid leaves of absence, also known as "sabbaticals."</p>
<p><b>Advancement and Professional Development Opportunities</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Is career advancement is important to you? If so, find out what the company offers. Is there room to move up in the company or department? When do employees typically get promoted? Does the employer offer tuition reimbursement or pay for other additional training? All of these things indicate whether the company will be a long-term fit versus just a stepping stone.</p>
<p><b>Company Culture and Work Environment</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>You'll be spending a lot of time at your new job, so take some time to learn about the company culture before accepting an offer. Here are some good questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many hours do people typically work per week?</li>
  <li>What are the company's values â€” and do they align with yours?</li>
  <li>Is there a dress code?</li>
  <li>How do the employees interact with each other?</li>
  <li>Do they work in teams or independently?</li>
  <li>How would you feel working in that environment?</li>
  <li>Does it seem like a good fit? If anything about the company or its employees makes you uncomfortable, that might be a sign to move on to the next offer.
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Work Schedule and Travel</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Flexible work environments are very important to some people, especially working parents with young children. If this is important to you, are these options available? Some employers accommodate employees by allowing them to work from home or providing alternative work schedules. Also, what are the travel requirements for this position?</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <b>Job Security</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>If job security is one of your "must haves", do some in-depth research on the company before accepting an offer. How is the company doing financially in comparison to other companies in the industry? Is the company growing or shrinking? Does there appear to be a lot of turnover? If the company's profits are down, layoffs are rampant, or there seems to be a revolving door, consider working somewhere else.</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <b>Other Considerations</b>
  <br>
</p>
<p>There are several other miscellaneous criteria to consider about a potential job offer. Examples include signing bonuses, relocation-cost reimbursements, company car, corporate discounts, onsite daycare, workout facilities and length of commute. Once you've evaluated every component of a job offer carefully, you'll be in a good position to make your final decision.</p>
<p>Congratulations on landing an offer! We'll see you out in the work world.</p>
