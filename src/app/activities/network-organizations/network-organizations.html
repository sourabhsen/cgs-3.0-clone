  <b>We can all use a few career shortcuts, and here's a great one.</b> If you want an easy way to meet like-minded people, get help with your job search, follow industry trends, and even get specialized training, then join a professional organization!</p>
<p>You can find one for virtually every industry. For example, the <a href="http://www.nursingworld.org/" target="_blank">American Nurses Association</a>, the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/" target="_blank">Project Management Institute</a>, the <a href="https://nrf.com/" target="_blank">National Retail Federation,</a> and many more. It's never too early (or too late) to begin to build relationships and learn more about your field.</p>
<p>If you're not sure which organizations to join, ask your colleagues or instructors to suggest a few. If you're a student, recent graduate, or currently between jobs, there may even be discounted or free memberships available! Whatever you do, make sure to be an active participant in any organization you join. Volunteer for projects, attend training seminars, and network, network, network!</p>
<p><b>Here are a few things to consider when choosing a professional organization:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it established, with hundreds or even thousands of current members?</li>
  <li>Do you know anyone who is a member?</li>
  <li>Do most senior-level people in your field belong to it, or have in the past?</li>
  <li>Can you attend local meetings and seminars that offer useful information?</li>
</ul>
