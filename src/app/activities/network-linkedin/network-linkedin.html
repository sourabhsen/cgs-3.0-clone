  You learned how to create a solid LinkedIn profile in <a ui-sref="auth.milestones({milestoneId: milestone.ids.image})" >Milestone {{milestone.ids.image}}</a>. Now it's time to build your LinkedIn network. Why? It's your key to the "hidden" job market!</p>
<p>LinkedIn is a professional social network with its own set of rules, which are quite different from how you probably behave on other sites like Facebook and Twitter. Think of it as an ongoing online job interview and behave accordingly!</p>
<p><b>Want to see your LinkedIn network grow fast?</b> Reach out to literally everyone you know -- current and former colleagues, friends, family, classmates, instructors and more. </p>
<p>LinkedIn's "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk" target="_blank">People You May Know</a>" feature can also help you find even more connections.</p>
<p>If you're nervous about inviting people to connect on LinkedIn, the following examples can help. Be sure to personalize them!</p>
<p>
  <b>Invite 1:</b>
  <div class="well">
    <p>Hi Adam,</p>
    <p>I hope you are doing well. My name is Sarah and I came across your profile while searching for a Human Resources Associate position at Southwest Airlines.</p>
    <p>It's great to see a University of Phoenix graduate doing so well in my field of study. If possible, I would love to set up some time for us to chat about your background and your career experience since graduation.</p>
    <p>I would really appreciate any career advice you could offer.</p>
    <p>Best,</p>
    <p>Sarah</p>

  <b>Invite 2:</b>
  <div class="well">
    <p>Hi Natalie,</p>
    <p>I noticed we're both in the Project Management group on LinkedIn, and that we're connected through a mutual friend, Bob Jones.</p>
    <p>I've heard great things about the Boeing Corporation, so I thought I'd reach out to you to see if I could learn more about the company and your role there.</p>
    <p>Would you be open to a quick call this Tuesday at noon or Thursday at 3pm to discuss your experience? Let me know if e-mail works best for you instead, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
    <p>Best,</p>
    <p>Sarah</p>

<p><b>Join LinkedIn Groups</b></p>
<p>Don't just rely on your current contacts to build your network. LinkedIn Groups can introduce you to new people while you learn more about your chosen field. LinkedIn has groups for literally everything, from software suites to the healthcare industry and even groups for people who've served in the same Army unit. Search for groups according to your interests and expertise by keyword. For example, search for “Adobe Photoshop” or “Marketing Gurus.”</p>
<p>Did you know LinkedIn Groups let you message anyone in the group, even if you're not already connected? Be sure to take advantage of that!</p>
<p>LinkedIn Groups Tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Get Advice.</b> Post a question to start a professional discussion. Reach out to anyone who provides answers, and say thanks!</li>
  <li><b>Be a Thought Leader</b>. Post interesting articles and ideas. Engage in discussions, answer other peoples' questions, and be a mentor. Remember, networking is a two-way street!</li>
  <li><b>Use Caution</b>. Be tactful. Only invite someone new into your network after you've discussed something together publicly.</li>
</ul>
