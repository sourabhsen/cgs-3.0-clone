<p>Hopefully you're already well-prepared for job interviews thanks to the practice tips presented in prior milestones. But there's no such thing as being TOO prepared! No matter how many interviews you've been on already, it's always a good time to brush up your interviewing skills.</p>
<p><b>Follow these steps each and every time you're preparing for a job interview</b>, and you'll just keep improving. Hiring managers are always impressed by someone who shows confidence, knowledge and ease during job interviews!</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Read the job description.</b> Note and jot down key details, and be prepared to discuss them.</li>
  <li><b>Research the company</b>. Don't just look at their website, read up on news stories that mention them. Talk to current employees if you know any. (Or visit <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com" target="_blank">Glassdoor.com</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Research the industry</b>. Use resources like <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/" target="_blank">Hoovers.com</a>, SWOT Analysis and business news sites like <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/" target="_blank">CNBC.com</a> and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/" target="_blank">WSJ.com</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Know who's interviewing you. </b>Ask the HR department to give you a list of interviewers when you set up the appointment, if possible. Look up their LinkedIn profiles, or read their bios on the company website.</li>
  <li><b>Memorize your resume.</b> Be able to speak about your skills and experience in detail.</li>
  <li><b>Dress the part.</b> A conservative business suit, closed-toe shoes, minimal makeup and reserved hairdo. Men should be clean-shaven, or beards should be neatly trimmed.</li>
  <li><b>Do a rehearsal interview</b> with your mentor or a trusted colleague.</li>
  <li><b>Write down four things</b> that make you the best candidate. Be prepared to discuss each one.</li>
  <li><b>Don't prepare "canned" answers</b> to interview questions. Instead, prepare entertaining stories about your accomplishments that you can use for a variety of situations.</li>
  <li><b>Arrive 30 minutes early.</b></li>
