  Now that you know what a cover letter is and why it's so important, how can you write one that gets you noticed? First off, did you know that there are two types of cover letters -- an informal email introduction letter and a traditional/formal cover letter? It's important to know when to use (and NOT to use) each type. You should always create drafts for both letter types and have them on hand so you can be ready to submit yours on demand. Get started on drafting yours as you work through these activities.</p>
<p><b>Informal Cover Letters</b></p>
<p>Use the “informal” cover letter, also called an email introduction, if you're applying for a job online through someone you know personally and have already met with in-person or by phone. This is also known as a “warm” invitation to apply, and is becoming quite common in the age of LinkedIn and other social media. In these cover letters, you're reiterating your existing relationship with the contact in your email, while sending your resume as a Word or PDF attachment.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a good informal cover letter:</p>

<p><b>Generic Online Cover Letters</b></p>
<p>You can use this modified version of the informal cover letter if you're applying for a job online through sites like SimplyHired, Indeed, or a company's internal job-application page, that only allow you to submit a brief cover letter via a few lines of cut-and-pasted plain text, where you often don't know who the hiring manager is. In those cases, just stick to a summary of your qualifications and use a generic greeting, like Dear Hiring Manager:</p>
<p>Here's an example of a generic online cover letter:</p>
<div class="well">
  <p>Dear Hiring Manager:</p>
  <p>Thank you for considering my online application for the Technical Writer position posted on SimplyHired. Per your posted requirements, I have three years' prior experience writing technical user manuals in an SAP database environment, along with a master's degree in Communications. I have completed the online application and my resume is attached in PDF format.</p>
  <p>Yours,</p>
  <p>Jane Smith</p>

<p>Before moving on to the next section, take a few minutes to draft some practice informal cover letters, and keep them handy so you can revise them in one of the later activities in this milestone.</p>
<p><b>Formal/Traditional Cover Letters</b></p>
<p>The traditional cover letter is longer and has the look and feel of an old-fashioned letter you'd get in the mail, even if you're submitting it as an electronic file attachment. You would use the formal/traditional cover letter anytime that an employer with whom you don't have an existing relationship says, "Please attach a cover letter and resume with your submission" or any other time you're specifically asked for one.</p>
<p>Even if it's not stated outright, sometimes employers will still require formal cover letters when you are applying through someone you know. When in doubt, always include a formal cover letter, even if it's attached to the more personalized email you send your “warm” contact.</p>
<p><b>Why the Formal/Traditional Cover Letter Is Different</b></p>
<p>While the informal cover letter is brief and to the point, a traditional cover letter is more in-depth, describing your professional and educational background, recent accomplishments, and specific interest in the company. You should plan to spend at least an hour composing and revising it each and every time you apply for a new job. This section will show you how to write a top-notch formal cover letter that grabs hiring managers' attention.</p>
<p>Don't forget to tailor your cover letter to the job you're applying for! Use the same job description you chose during the Resume milestone to help you complete this activity, or choose a new one from the <span class="career-tool"><a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId:'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search</a></span> tool if you like. Take note of the job's requirements and think about how you and your skillset match them.</p>
<p>Now, open a Word document and start writing! Follow these steps to help you craft the best letter possible:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are the top three most desired skills that the employer is looking for in the job description? (The skills you list will help you with the body of your cover letter).</li>
  <li>What are your biggest accomplishments based on these identified skills? Building off the skills you have chosen, your accomplishments whether professional, volunteer or school experience, should help the hiring manager understand what assets you can bring to their company and role.</li>
  <li>Once you've figured out how you'll be describing yourself, you're ready to learn more about the company so you can demonstrate how your skills match their needs. Review the company's website and do a Google search for additional information, like recent news reports on the company. Think about what interests or excites you most about the employer as you do your research, and plan to use those ideas when crafting the introduction of your cover letter. Remember to be sincere and not “salesy.”</li>
  <li>You identified the job's essential skills, you know what the company wants, and you've shown how you have exactly what they're looking for. Now it's time to close your letter and thank hiring managers for their consideration. Don't forget to say exactly how and when you'll follow up with them, and mark your calendar! End your cover letter with "Sincerely," followed by your name.</li>
</ol>

<p>How is your writing session going? By now you should have drafted at least two or three different cover letters; both informal and formal, because you can expect to use both types in your job search. Go back and write them now if you haven't already, and get ready to revise and polish them in the next milestone!</p>
