<p><b>Research is essential preparation for any interview</b> â€“ because the more you know about the company, the more impressed your interviewer will be. It shows that you are truly interested in the job, and that you take initiative. To really stand out, demonstrate your knowledge of the company throughout the interview, especially at the end, where you can delve even deeper by asking questions around what you've already learned.</p>
<p>Follow these steps when conducting your company research:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Visit the company website.</b> Review its history, mission and vision statements, management structure, products and services to make sure you have a good understanding of the organization. If you know the names of individuals you are interviewing, check out their LinkedIn profiles to learn about their background and experience.</li>
  <li><b>Research the company online.</b> Start by Googling the company's name, and then branch out by searching news sites like <a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/" target="_blank">CNNMoney.com</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>. The business section of your local paper can also be a good source. Don't just focus on the company, read up on how it fits into its industry and the marketplace. Who are the major competitors? What new products are trending, and which ones are on their way out?</li>
