<h3>Where to find jobs:</h3>
<p><b>When it comes to your job search, it pays to be strategic.</b> Start with the end in mind -- what are your current career goals? Gravitate towards the postings that can help you accomplish them. For example, if your current goal is to become a marketing manager but you only have experience working as an administrative assistant so far, do a keyword search for "marketing coordinator" on our <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search tool</a>, because this position is the next logical step in your career plan, it's an entry level position for the job of a Marketing Manager.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet set your career goals, get started with our <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'careerExploration', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Career Exploration tool</a>. No matter where you are on your career trajectory, setting clear and achievable goals will help you target your job search in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p>Your job search is a lot like a road trip. Once you have an idea where you want to go, you need a map for how to get there. The following resources can help you find potential employers and positions that match your current career goals; think of them as your own personal GPS system.</p>
<p>
  <b>The <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search tool</a> gathers current job postings from thousands of employers</b> and makes them easy to search.

</p>
<p>Have you heard of the "hidden job market?" It refers to the fact that many of today's best jobs are never publicly posted, but instead filled via insider connections with hiring managers. Not only that, hiring managers almost always prefer job candidates that are referred to them by their company's current employees. (In other words, networking is the name of the game). <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> is the best way to build your professional network, not to mention to show you how you and your dream company are already connected.</p>
<p>If professional networking makes you nervous, never fear. Go to the <a ui-sref="auth.milestones({milestoneId: milestone.ids.image})" >Building Your Professional Brand</a> milestone and learn how you can build a LinkedIn profile that gets hiring managers' attention.</p>

</p>
<p>Another method of finding job opportunities is to focus on specific employers. Once you have identified employers, you can start looking for open opportunities.</p>
<p><i>Forbes</i> publishes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/" target="_blank">lists</a> each year, many of them highlight great companies. A couple of these lists are the "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/global2000/" target="_blank">Global 2000 Leading Companies</a>" and "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/" target="_blank">World's Most Innovative Companies</a>."</p>
<h3><b>INC 5000</b></h3>
<p>The INC 5000 is a <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000" target="_blank">yearly list of America's 5000 fastest-growing companies</a>. (Hint: Fast-growing companies are hiring the most!)</p>
<h3><b>Recruiting Firms</b></h3>
<p>Also known as "headhunters," recruiting firms help match employers with qualified job candidates -- and are often the only way to apply for some types of positions, especially in management and technology. Talk to your instructors and colleagues and do some online research to find out which firms recruit top talent in the fields that interest you.</p>
<h3>Deciding what jobs to apply to:</h3>
<p>Once you have a list of potential employers and job postings, it's time to prioritize them. This will help you ensure you're only spending time on the best possible job opportunities for you.</p>
<p>Your job search is about quality, not quantity, so don't waste time and energy on positions that aren't the right fit for you. Plus, every job application takes time; you have to find the right posting, customize your resume to fit its requirements, write a cover letter, and submit your application. To ensure you aren't wasting your valuable time applying for positions that aren't right for you, take your list of top jobs from above and start assessing each one according to the following criteria. You'll then probably find that some will rank higher on your list of priorities, and you decide to remove a few others completely. It will likely take you a few weeks to apply for every position on your list, so make sure you apply to the ones that interest you most first.</p>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind when prioritizing your list of potential jobs and companies:</p>
<p><b>Interest and Skill Match</b></p>
<p>How well does this job match your current interests and skills? Take another look at your <a ui-sref="auth.interestSurvey.results({header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>interest assessment results</a> (or your own soul-searching) and the skill requirements listed in the <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'careerExploration', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Career Exploration tool</a>.</p>
<p><b>Salary</b></p>
<p>Money talks. How well does this job pay compared to other jobs in your area, as well as other regions of the country? Don't forget to factor in your local cost of living (i.e., rent, mortgage, gas) as well as your other obligations, such as student-loan payments, when calculating a desirable (and realistic) salary. You can check the salary range for any job by going back to your <a href="/career-plan/career-exploration/my-goals.html">My Goals list</a>. In addition, you can use <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor.com</a> to view salary information posted anonymously by current and former employees at your target companies.</p>
<p><b>Culture</b></p>
<p>Is this a company that you would want to work for? Does the company's mission and culture match your values? Your success or happiness in a position may depend on how well you mesh within the organization. You can also use <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor.com</a> to learn everything from employee morale to perks to whether a company might be on the verge of implosion. Look for trends rather than a single scathing report.</p>
<p><b>Company Growth</b></p>
<p>Is the company growing or shrinking? You can do a Google search to investigate. Focus on growth companies. It pays to drill down some more about the organization once you're considering a specific job.</p>
<p><b>Colleagues</b></p>
<p>If you happen know someone at the company, reach out to them to see if this is a company you want to work for.</p>
<p><b>Commute</b></p>
<p>How far is the office from your house? This might not seem like a big deal, but don't underestimate the value of short commute. Less time on the road means more hours in your day -- not to mention more money in your pocket thanks to lower commuting costs.</p>
