<p><b>An elevator pitch is a thirty-second commercial with you as the star.</b>&nbsp;Whether you're at a dinner party or your kid's soccer game, somebody will eventually ask, "So, what do you do for a living?". That's your chance to wow them with your elevator pitch. You never know whether the person standing behind you in line at the store is also a hiring manager looking for someone with your exact talents!</p>
<p><b>Here's an example of a great elevator pitch:</b></p>

<h3>How do you create your elevator pitch?</h3>
<p><b>1. Start by writing it down</b></p>
<p>Get a piece of paper and write down what makes you and your skills so valuable. Remember the following (you'll have the opportunity to practice and record your pitch later):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Know your audience.</b> Just like you tailor your resume to fit each job posting, you should do the same for your elevator pitch. A fun, casual tone is great to use at a dinner party, while formal and businesslike is for attending networking events.</li>
  <li><b>Introduce yourself.</b> First impressions are everything, so be sure to show just how confident you are. Stand up straight, give a firm handshake, and state your name slowly and clearly. Eye contact and a bright smile work wonders (don't stare at the floor or over the listener's head). Be friendly and confident, yet sincere.</li>
  <li><b>Keep it professional.</b> This is NOT the time to talk about your kids and family, this is about you as a professional. Anything that is not related to work or school should be left out.</li>
  <li><b>Talk about your skills.</b> Make sure you highlight the right skills for the right industry. For example, if you're a math whiz and great with budgets, highlight that whenever you talk to a banking professional.</li>
  <li><b>Highlight your accomplishments.</b> You've only got thirty seconds, so keep your pitch focused on your key accomplishments. For example, you could say, "I increased departmental efficiency by 72% in three months." Recent graduates might say, "I graduated last year with 3.6 GPA in Accounting." Achievements count.</li>
  <li><b>Show that you are interested.</b> End with something like, "I'd love to learn more about your company and how I could contribute to your goals." If you already know something about the company make it personal, "I really like the â€˜Summer Time is Pepsi Time' ad campaign you're running right now. What's next in the pipeline? I would love to be involved."</li>
  <li><b>Stay in contact.</b> Exchange business cards or email addresses with all the new contacts you pitch. (If you don't have professional business cards, get some made at your local print shop or on <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com/" target="_blank">Vistaprint.com</a>). Send a brief email within a day or two to thank them for their time and consideration. Don't forget to ask each new contact if you can add them on LinkedIn!</li>
</ul>
<p>After you write your pitch, say it aloud to hear what it sounds like. Make changes to your script until it seems natural and it addresses all of the bullets above.</p>
<p><b>2. Practice your pitch.</b></p>
<p>Once you are have a solid pitch written, it is time to memorize. Start in front of a mirror and recite it until it becomes natural -- you want to sound relaxed and conversational, not like you're giving a canned speech. Practice it until you can recite it on command!</p>
