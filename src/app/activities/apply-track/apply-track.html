<p><b>It's important to follow up on all jobs that you apply to.</b></p>
<p>It is best to politely follow up within 1-2 weeks of submitting an application. In most circumstances you should only follow up with an application twice (each follow up spaced about 2 weeks apart). Here is an example of how you can follow up with an application that you already submitted.</p>
<div class="well">
  <p>Dear PERSON'S NAME,</p>
  <p>I wanted to follow up on the application I submitted for JOB TITLE with COMPANY NAME. I am very excited about this opportunity and would love the chance to further explain my qualifications.</p>
  <p>I have attached my resume and cover letter for reference. Please let me know if there are any additional materials that I can provide.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your consideration,</p>
  <p>Your Name</p>
</div>
<p><b>Keep track of all of your job applications</b></p>
<p>You should keep track of the progress for all of the jobs you apply to. Did you send a follow up email to that job you applied to two weeks ago? What happened with that one company you were talking to 2 months ago. Keeping a single list of all job applications will save you time and make sure that you don't forget something like a follow up.</p>
<p><b>We created the Applied Jobs list to help you stay organized:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Centralized list of all of your job applications.</li>
  <li>Jobs will automatically be added to your Applied Jobs list when you apply through the <a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId: 'jobsearch', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Job Search tool</a>.</li>
  <li>If you applied on a different job site you can quickly add it to your applied jobs list.</li>
  <li>Easily update the status of each job application to stay organized.</li>
  <li>"Autotrack" functionality available for select jobs. You can enter your company username and password for these "Autotrack" jobs and we will automatically track your application status for you</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Look for patterns:</b></p>
<p>Are you getting interviews but no job offers? You probably need to brush up on your interviewing skills. Are you applying to a lot of jobs but not getting any interviews? You probably need to spend more time focusing on the jobs that are the best fit and try to find an inside connection at these companies.</p>
<p>The more you track and analyze how your job search is going, the better results you'll get.</p>
