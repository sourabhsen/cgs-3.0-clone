<p>With something as important as a job interview, it's important to set aside as much practice time as possible to make sure you're prepared to knock the hiring manager's socks off! Here are some resources for practicing your interviewing skills:</p>
<h3><b>Use the Interview Preparation tool</b></h3>
<p>You've already seen our <span class="career-tool"><a ui-sref="auth.tools({toolId:'interviewPreparation', header: 'tool', from: milestone.milestoneId, fromAnchor: milestone.anchor})" inherit-breadcrumb>Interview Preparation tool</a></span>. Come back to it often during your job search to keep your interview skills fresh. You'll go on many job interviews throughout your career, so it's important not to get rusty!</p>

<h3><b>Connect with a Mentor</b></h3>
<p>Find a mentor with experience working in your chosen field who can help give you feedback while you prepare for interviews. You can find mentors via instructors, classmates, your LinkedIn network, or the University alumni mentor network, which you learned about during <a ui-sref="auth.milestones({milestoneId: milestone.ids.network})" >Milestone {{milestone.ids.network}}</a>. Friends and family who are further along in their careers may also be able to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give your mentor a set of sample questions to ask you, and then answer them as if it were a real interview. Your “interviewer” can provide feedback on how you did, and maybe even some additional advice or sample questions based on their own work experience. <!-- If you would like to practice your interviewing skills with an interview expert, <a href="mailto:careercoachinghelpdesk@phoenix.edu?subject=PCGS-MS7%3A%20Interviewing&amp;body=Name%3A%0AAcademic%20Program%3A%0ACareer%20Goal%3A%0AInterview%20Question%3A%20(Please%20attach%20your%20cover%20letter%2C%20resume%20and%20job%20description)"><b>connect with one here</b></a> -->.</p>
<!-- <p>Take all your practice sessions seriously — dress professionally and behave just as you would on a real interview.</p>
<h3><b>Get feedback from a Career Advisor</b></h3>
<p>You can record a practice video of yourself answering interview questions and get feedback from one of our Career Advisors. (You'll need a webcam and microphone.)</p>
<p>We have created two different playlists of interview questions, common interview questions and behavioral interview questions. There is a good chance you would hear questions from both playlists in a typical interview, we recommend that you practice both.</p>
<p><b>Here's how it works:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose an interview question playlist (Common questions or behavioral questions) .</li>
  <li>HireVue software will open in a new tab and make sure your webcam and microphone work.</li>
  <li>You'll start with a practice question to get comfortable with the recording system.</li>
  <li>You will then be prompted to answer 5 interview questions (you can re-record each answer as many times as you like).</li>
  <li>When you're comfortable with each answer, you can submit your practice interview for review.</li>
  <li>A Career Advisor will review your answers and email you feedback within 3 business days. (Don't forget to check your spam/junk folder).</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p><b>Career Advisors will be looking for the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you communicate how your work experience is relevant for a specific job opening?</li>
  <li>Are you knowledgeable about the company and industry?</li>
  <li>Do you discuss how your strengths and goals align with the position and company?</li>
  <li>Do you appropriately acknowledge any weaknesses or past mistakes?</li>
  <li>Do you speak clearly and confidently?</li>
</ul> -->
<h3><b>Leading up to interview day</b></h3>
<p><b>There are a few things you should keep in mind before your real interview:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Plan every detail of your interview day well in advance. For example, several days before the interview, do a “dry run” to see how much time it takes you to get to the interview location and how long it takes you to find parking if you're driving.</li>
  <li>Get there 30 minutes early, and check in with the receptionist 10 minutes before the interview.</li>
  <li>Go for a run, take a walk, or listen to music so you are relaxed. Be sure to eat a good breakfast, and do your preparation well in advance -- don't cram the morning of the interview!</li>
  <li>Bring a few paper copies of your resume to the interview. One for yourself, and one for each person interviewing you.</li>
  <li>Bring a professional-looking notebook and pen so you can jot down key points during the interview, or things you want to ask questions about later.</li>
</ul>
