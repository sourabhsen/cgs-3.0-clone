<p><b>Tired of applying for jobs and never hearing back?</b> It's easy to get lost in the sea of applicants these days. But you have a better chance of can get ting your resume to the top of the pile by connecting with people you already know at the company.</p>
<p>Knowing someone who is already working for your target employer is a major advantage in your job search. Many companies hire a significant number of their staff through employee referrals and consider this a great way to find strong candidates. If you are referred by a current employee, it is more likely that your resume will get fast-tracked to the hiring manager's desk, instead of sitting in a flooded email inbox.</p>
<h3>Here are a few ways to get the "insider advantage":</h3>
<p><b>Connections to the company</b> - Do you know anyone currently at the company or a friend of a friend? If so, reach out to them. Have a phone conversation or meet over coffee. Politely ask your friend or colleague if they know of any openings, and if they would mind forwarding your resume to hiring managers. Be sure to thank them, and return the favor, even if it's just buying them coffee or lunch.</p>
<p>Not sure if you know anybody at your target company? Use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to find out. First, look up a target employer. Then click on the "How You're Connected" box and view all your connections. Finally, click on the "Connect" drop down window and select "Get introduced."</p>
<p>Here is an example of a short message to a connection asking for an introduction. Remember to be polite and thank them ahead of time.</p>

  <p>Hi Sally,</p>
  <p>We met at a recent Women in Technology conference and had a great discussion on the importance of diversity in tech.</p>
  <p>I am currently exploring new career opportunities and am interested in setting up an informational interview with Joey Choo, one of your connections on LinkedIn.</p>
  <p>I would like to ask her about her experience at Google and in the tech industry in general. I would very much appreciate it if you would forward my message to Ms. Choo.</p>
  <p>Thanks for your help,</p>
  <p>Stacy Smith</p>

<p><b>Recruiters</b> - LinkedIn is also a great place to find internal recruiters at the companies you're targeting. You can perform an advanced search by clicking "Advanced" next to the search bar at the top. Type in the company name in the "company" field and "recruiter" in the job title field. If you find a recruiter for your desired company in the search results, connect with him/her by sending a LinkedIn email message (see example below). Even if there are no openings currently posted, this strategy can get you on the company's radar screen, and recruiters may think of you first when they do have a position to fill.</p>

  <p>Hi Steve,</p>
  <p>I hope you are doing well at Adobe.</p>
  <p>My name is John and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Marketing at the University of Phoenix.</p>
  <p>I came across the Inbound Marketing Specialist Internship and I think I would make a great fit for this role based on my experience with working on school projects in multiple computer languages such as HTML, CSS and XML.</p>
  <p>Would you be available for a brief 20 minute conversation to go over what Adobe looks for in a candidate and this position specifically?</p>
  <p>Best regards,</p>
  <p>John James</p>
