  The best elevator pitch in the world won’t help you if your Instagram account is littered with unflattering pictures of you boozing it up on Friday night or your Twitter feed is nothing but tacky jokes. We’ve all made a few faux pas online, but now is the time to clean things up, especially because according to HR Today magazine, 70 percent of U.S. Human Resources pros have rejected a job applicant based on what they discovered by searching online. You don’t want to be one of them, so watch this short video:</p>

<p><b>Use the tips below to boost your personal brand online:</b></p>
<p><b>1. “Google” yourself.</b></p>
<p>Employers will Google you, so why not beat them to it? Search for yourself and see what comes up, paying close attention to anything that’s unprofessional or inaccurate. Delete any unflattering pictures from your social media accounts, and untag yourself from other peoples’ feeds. Also, beef up your privacy settings on your personal online accounts. Remember, you should still assume anything you post online will be there forever.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, anything you do post online should be positive, informative, and related to your field of expertise, like sharing content on the latest marketing trends, for example. Most importantly, keep everything current. When employers Google you, everything they see should represent who you are right now.</p>
<p>
  Type your name into the search box below and remove or hide anything that an employer shouldn't see:
  <br/>
  <form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search" target="_blank" style="background: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 25px;">
    <input type="text" name="q" size="31" maxlength="255" style="height: 30px; width: 50%; margin-right: 15px;">
    <input type="submit" class="button" value="Google Search">
  </form>
</p>
<p><b>2. Be professional.</b></p>
<p>Your public online presence should be both accessible and professional. Most employers will be uneasy if they Google you and don’t find anything at all. At minimum, have a LinkedIn profile set to “Public” and keep it updated with your latest accomplishments. Use a professional current headshot, and continue to build your network.
</p>
<p><b>3. Watch what you say.</b></p>
<p>It’s fun to chat online, but be careful. Don’t do anything online you wouldn’t be comfortable having your boss see because you never know who might be watching, or when!</p>
