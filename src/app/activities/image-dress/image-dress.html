<p>Your skills, personal brand and elevator pitch will only get you so far -- don't blow it by looking sloppy. Devote just as much time to your appearance as you do to crafting your resume and prepping for interviews. Did you know that you can make or break your chances of getting hired the moment you walk in the door by choosing the right (or wrong) outfit?</p>
<h3><b>For interviews, keep it conservative.</b></h3>
<p>Now is not the time to show off your favorite jeans. No matter what a company's regular dress code might be, dress professionally to the interview. Below are quick tips and videos for how you can make the best first impression with employers, no matter the industry.</p>
<h3><b>Men's guide to dressing professionally</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wear a tailored jacket, dress slacks and collared shirt with a necktie.</li>
  <li>Suit colors should be muted — black, dark brown, or navy blue.</li>
  <li>Shirts should be white or pastel and well-ironed. Avoid bright colors and wild patterns, though a colorful tie or pocket square is acceptable.</li>
  <li>Leather dress loafers in black or brown are best, and dark dress socks too. No sneakers, gym socks or bare ankles, please.</li>
  <li>Wear a leather dress belt that matches the color of your dress shoes.</li>
  <li>Make sure you know how to tie an Oxford knot for your necktie — if you don't, have somebody show you.</li>
  <li>Get a haircut, and trim your beard if you wear one.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Don't break the bank.</b></h3>
<p>Don't have a business wardrobe just yet? Worried it'll cost a fortune? Don't fret. National chains like K&amp;G, Burlington, JCPenney and Marshalls specialize in quality career wear at discount prices. Thrift shops and consignment stores are another option, as are some charities that help job-seekers get on track. Or borrow from a friend.</p>
